# Dataset Assignments Repository

This repository contains a collection of Python projects and assignments focused on data exploration, preprocessing, and machine learning workflows using datasets. These assignments demonstrate key concepts like data cleaning, forecasting, visualization, and evaluation using modern tools like **pandas**, **Prophet**, and **scikit-learn**.

## Completed Assignments

### 1. **CIFAR-10 Dataset Preprocessing**

- Extracted and loaded CIFAR-10 image batches
- Combined and reshaped training data
- Normalized pixel values and saved to `.npy`
- Visualized 15 labeled images with category names

### 2. **Time Series Prediction (Prophet Tutorial)**

- Forecasted daily temperatures for New York using Facebook Prophet
- Plotted actual vs predicted values
- Calculated and printed Mean Absolute Error (MAE)

---

## Tools Used

- `pandas`
- `Prophet`
- `matplotlib`
- `sklearn`

---

## Notes

- Large data files (`.npy`, `.tar.gz`) are excluded from GitHub using `.gitignore`
- All code is written in Python 3.12 and executed in VS Code with Anaconda

---

## Upcoming Sections

- Time Series Challenge
- YAML Exploration Assignment
- Custom Dataset Projects

## How to Run

To try out the assignments in this repo:

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/evenmillz/dataset_assignments.git
cd dataset_assignments
```

### 2. Set Up Environment

Make sure you have Python 3.12 and Anaconda installed. Create a new environment (optional but recommended):

```bash
conda create -n data_env python=3.12
conda activate data_env
pip install -r requirements.txt  # if requirements.txt is available
```

### 3. Run CIFAR-10 Preprocessing

```bash
cd cifar10_project
python preprocess_cifar10_dataset.py
python verify_preprocessed_data.py
```

### 4. Run Time Series Forecasting

```bash
cd ../tsp_tutorial_assignment
python temperature_prediction.py
```
